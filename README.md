# Rust Tracer
This is a minimal implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I started this project in order to learn Rust so it contains a lot of spaghetti code.

At the moment I have implemented everything up to section 5. This repo will be constantly updated. A lot of refactoring is on the way.
